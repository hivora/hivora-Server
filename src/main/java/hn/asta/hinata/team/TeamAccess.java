/**
 * Pure (Spring-free) computation of which of a team's projects a user may see
 * through that team. Shared by {@link TeamService} (the Teams UI) and
 * {@code ProjectService} (app-wide project gating) so the rule lives in one
 * place and the two services don't form a bean cycle.
 *
 * <p>Team-Admins always see every project the team owns; otherwise the
 * membership's {@link ProjectAccess} decides (ALL / SOME / NONE). Returned ids
 * are always intersected with the team's current {@code projectIds}, so a stale
 * {@code SOME} entry for a detached project can never grant access.
